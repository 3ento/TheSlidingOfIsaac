                    <h1>Lore</h1>
                    <p>In biblical lore, Azazel is a name that appears in various contexts, particularly in the Old
                        Testament. The
                        interpretation of Azazel varies, and its exact meaning and significance are not entirely clear.
                        The name is mentioned in
                        the context of the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) rituals described in the book of Leviticus.</p>

                    <p>In Leviticus 16:8-10 (New International Version), the passage states:</p>

                    <p>"The Lord said to Moses, 'Take Aaron and his sons with him, the garments, the anointing oil, the
                        bull for the sin
                        offering, the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast, and gather the entire
                        assembly at the
                        entrance to the tent of meeting.' Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and the assembly gathered
                        at the entrance to
                        the tent of meeting."</p>

                    <p>In Leviticus 16:20-22, the high priest is instructed to lay his hands on the head of a live goat
                        and confess over it
                        all the sins and transgressions of the Israelites. The goat is then sent into the wilderness,
                        symbolically carrying
                        away the sins of the people. This goat is sometimes referred to as the "scapegoat."</p>

                    <p>The term "Azazel" is associated with this scapegoat. Some interpretations suggest that Azazel may
                        represent a demon
                        or a symbolic figure associated with the wilderness or desolation. The exact identity and nature
                        of Azazel have been
                        the subject of much debate and speculation throughout history.</p>

                    <p>In later Jewish tradition and some apocryphal texts, Azazel is sometimes depicted as a fallen
                        angel or a rebellious
                        figure. However, it's important to note that these later interpretations are not explicitly
                        found in the canonical
                        Hebrew Bible.</p>

                    <p>The understanding of Azazel varies among different religious traditions and interpretations, and
                        it's important to
                        consider the historical and cultural context of the biblical passages in question.</p>

                    <p> <mark style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Connection with game lore</mark>:
                        Another sinful persona Isaac imagines himself as. He sees himself as guilty of everything wrong in his life, so he imagines himself as a scapegoat, the one to take all the blame and sins of his family, and repent.
