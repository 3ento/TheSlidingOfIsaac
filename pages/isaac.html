                    <p>The D6 turns him into one of the most versatile characters, as it elevates quite a bit of the RNG
                        involved in a TBOI run, allowing you to use game knowledge to get a lot more out of a floor than
                        otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Isaac is one of the character that benefits the most from item pool knowledge, secret rooms and
                        active item charge conservation.</p>
                    <p> <mark style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Strategy:</mark> Always look for

                            style="width: 18px; height: 18px;"> when possible. Even
                        early on they have a
                        pool of very
                        powerful items like 1up!<img src="../resources/images/items/Collectible_1up!_icon_webp.png"
                            style="width: 18px; height: 18px;">, Infamy<img

                            style="width: 20px; height: 20px;">,
                        Lost Contact<img src="../resources/images/items/Collectible_Lost_Contact_icon_webp.png"
                            style="width: 20px; height: 20px;"> (depending on build, detrimental
                        on low tear rate
                        builds but game breaking with a high tear rate and amount) and Odd Mushroom<img
                            src="../resources/images/items/Collectible_Odd_Mushroom_(Thin)_icon_webp.png"
                            style="width: 20px; height: 20px;">. Other than that, be
                        aware of your D6 charges and amount of rooms remaining to maximize uses. Try to save a charge
                        for the boss item, as the boss item pool is much smaller that the golden room one. In case of an
                        hp up, it's a good gamble to reroll, as it'll either reroll into something better, or another hp
                        up (most cases).</p>

                    <h1>Lore</h1>
                    <p>In the Hebrew Bible, Isaac is a <mark>significant figure and one of the patriarchs</mark>. He is
                        the son of
                        Abraham and Sarah and is considered one of the three patriarchs of the Israelites, along with
                        his father Abraham and his son Jacob. The story of Isaac is primarily found in the <mark>Book of
                            Genesis</mark>.</p>
                    <p>One of the most well-known narratives involving Isaac is the Akedah, also known as <mark>the
                            Binding of Isaac</mark>. In this story, God tests Abraham's faith by instructing him to
                        sacrifice
                        his son
                        Isaac. However, at the last moment, an angel intervenes and prevents the sacrifice, providing a
                        ram for Abraham to sacrifice instead.</p>
                    <p>Isaac later marries Rebekah, and they have twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Jacob, the younger twin,
                        eventually becomes the father of the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
                    <p>Isaac is often remembered as a figure of <mark>obedience, faith</mark>, and the covenant between
                        God and the
                        descendants of Abraham. His life and the stories surrounding him are foundational to the
                        narratives of the Hebrew Bible and the development of the Israelite people.</p>
                    <img class="lore-img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Isaac_a_Lover_of_Peace.jpg" alt="Lore Isaac">
                    <p> <mark style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Connection with game lore</mark>: The
                        game only really takes from
                        The Binding of Isaac
                        <span style="font-size: 12px;">(heh)</span>, as the
                        themes of obedience and faith reflect Isaac's mother's extremist faith that ultimately broke
                        their family. So, at it's core, The Binding of Isaac, the game, is an antithesis of the Bible
                        story, exploring the implications of such extreme levels of devotion and faith and their impact
                        on the young mind (Isaac)
