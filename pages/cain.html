                        Cain's kit makes him the best character for hoarding items. His starting luck increases the
                        chance of a drop after a room clear, and Lucky Foot boosts this even further by increasing his
                        success for room drops and machines like Slot Machines, Fortune Telling Machines, Shell Games,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>As Cain is likely to have a large collection of coins or keys after a few floors, it is wise to
                        open up Shops, bomb Shopkeepers, donate ten coins to a Donation Machine, or donate to a Beggar
                        till he pays out to maximize the chances of an Angel Room. Cain benefits more from them compared
                        to Devil Rooms due to his low health.</p>
                    <p>Because Lucky Foot
                        changes bad pills into good pills, pills are extremely effective for Cain. This makes Golden
                        Pills and (in Repentance)Echo Chamber great finds for Cain, as he will receive multiple
                        guaranteed buffs from the pills.</p>

                    <h1>Lore</h1>
                    <p>Cain is a figure mentioned in the Bible, particularly in the <mark>book of Genesis</mark>. He is
                        known as the
                        firstborn son of Adam and Eve, the first human couple created by God. The story of Cain and
                        Abel,
                        his younger brother, is one of the well-known narratives in the Bible.</p>

                    <p>According to the biblical account, Cain and Abel both offered sacrifices to God. God favored
                        Abel's
                        offering, which was a lamb, but rejected Cain's offering of fruits and vegetables. Out of
                        jealousy
                        and anger, Cain lured Abel into a field and killed him. When God questioned Cain about Abel's
                        whereabouts, Cain famously responded, "Am I my brother's keeper?"</p>

                    <p>As a consequence of his crime, God cursed Cain, making the land unproductive for him and forcing
                        him
                        to be a wanderer. However, God also placed a mark on Cain to protect him from being killed by
                        others. The story of Cain and Abel is often interpreted as a cautionary tale about jealousy,
                        disobedience, and the consequences of sin.</p>

                    <p> <mark style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Connection with game lore</mark>:
                        Isaac often sees himself as a sinner, as seen in many endings, particularly in ending 17. So
                        naturally many of the playable characters are sinners. Abel can actually be encountered ingame
                        as an item <img src="../resources/images/items/Collectible_Abel_icon_webp.png" width="5%">, a
                        familiar that mirros Isaacs movement and shoots 3.5dmg tears. When playing as Cain, the damage
                        is upped to 7.5 and the tears turn red.
