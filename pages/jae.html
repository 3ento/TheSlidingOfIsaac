                    <p>Jacob and Esau are a character pair added in The Binding of Isaac: Repentance. They are unlocked
                        by defeating Mother<img

                            height="20"> with any character.</p>

                    <p>Jacob and Esau are controlled as one, move at the same speed, and use the same coins,
                        Bombs, and Keys. Otherwise, they are completely independent in terms of stats, items, and
                        health. Both
                        characters have collision and can be separated, though the "Drop" (Ctrl by default) button can
                        be held to keep
                        Esau in place while Jacob is free to move around the room.</p>

                    <p>If either Jacob or Esau die, they both die regardless of the other character's remaining health.

                        <br>
                        Don't. This character sucks.
                        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Buuut their unlocks are the best in the game, so here are a few things to keep in mind when playing this terrible
                        character. By positioning them seperately in front of 2 item pedestals, they can take
                        both. So going alt path is recommended. You can use walls to line them up as tight as
                        possible, as well as putting the one with more HP in front as a shield. Because there's
                        2 of them, their inital DPS isn't too bad for the start. Beware that they can fly
                        seperately, so taking flying items can mess with movement a lot. When placing a bomb,
                        both characters place one, effectively getting 2 bombs for 1. Only one of them takes
                        damage when going through a Cursed room door, but both pass. </p>

                    <h1>Lore</h1>
                    <p>The story of Jacob and Esau is a prominent narrative in the Book of Genesis, specifically in
                        chapters 25-36. Jacob and
                        Esau were twin brothers born to Isaac and Rebekah, and their story is characterized by themes of
                        sibling rivalry,
                        deception, and divine intervention.</p>

                    <p>Here is a summary of the key events in the story:</p>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.2em;">Birth and Early Life:</p>
                    Rebekah, Isaac's wife, was barren, but after praying to the Lord, she became pregnant with twins.
                    The twins struggled within her womb, and God revealed to Rebekah that two nations were in her womb
                    and that the older
                    would serve the younger.</p>
                    Esau was born first, and he was described as a skillful hunter, while Jacob was born holding onto
                    Esau's heel, hence the
                    name "Jacob," which means "heel-grabber" or "supplanter."</p>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.2em;">The Birthright and Blessing:</p>
                    Esau, as the firstborn, held the birthright, which entitled him to a double portion of the family
                    inheritance.
                    Jacob, however, was cunning. On one occasion, Esau returned from hunting famished and sold his
                    birthright to Jacob for a
                    bowl of lentil stew.</p>
                    Later in the story, Isaac, who was old and blind, intended to bless Esau before his death. However,
                    with Rebekah's
                    assistance, Jacob deceived Isaac into blessing him instead.</p>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.2em;">Jacob's Flight and Reconciliation:</p>
                    Fearing Esau's anger, Jacob fled to his uncle Laban's house in Haran.
                    While there, Jacob worked for Laban and married Leah and Rachel, Laban's daughters.
                    After many years, Jacob decided to return to his homeland, and on the journey back, he reconciled
                    with Esau. Esau,
                    despite initial anger, embraced Jacob, and they reconciled.</p>

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.2em;">Name Change:</p>
                    During Jacob's journey, he had a mysterious encounter with a divine being (often interpreted as an
                    angel or God
                    Himself). Jacob wrestled with this being and demanded a blessing.
                    As a result of the encounter, Jacob's name was changed to Israel, meaning "he who strives with God"
                    or "God strives."</p>

                    <p>The story of Jacob and Esau is significant in biblical narrative and has theological
                        implications. It is seen as
                        illustrating God's sovereignty in choosing Jacob, the younger twin, over Esau, and it sets the
                        stage for the formation
                        of the twelve tribes of Israel. The descendants of Jacob (Israel) become the Israelites, while
                        the descendants of Esau
                        become the Edomites, and their interactions are depicted in various parts of the Bible.</p>

                    <p> <mark style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Connection with game lore</mark>: I
                        have no idea. They originate from a mod called Antibirth, which eventually became the offical
                        DLC Repentance, so I guess the Antibirth devs though the gameplay gimmick would be cool (it's
                        not) and used the bible story as a reference. Plus it's kinda cool to have Isaac's cannon
                        children in the game, I guess.
