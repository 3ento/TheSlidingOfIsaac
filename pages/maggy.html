                    <h1>Lore</h1>
                    <p>Mary Magdalene is a figure mentioned in the <mark>New Testament</mark> of the Bible. She is often
                        identified
                        as a follower of Jesus Christ. The Gospels describe her as a woman who had been healed of
                        <mark>seven
                            demons</mark> by Jesus and who subsequently became one of his close companions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Mary Magdalene is particularly prominent in the accounts of the crucifixion and resurrection of
                        Jesus. According to the Gospels, she was present at the crucifixion and, after Jesus' burial,
                        she went to the tomb on the third day to anoint his body. There, she encountered the risen
                        Jesus, and he instructed her to go and tell the disciples about his resurrection.</p>

                    <p>Over the centuries, Mary Magdalene has been the subject of various interpretations and
                        traditions. In some Christian traditions, she is considered a symbol of <mark>repentance</mark>
                        and
                        redemption, while in others, she is regarded as a prominent disciple and witness to the
                        resurrection. However, it's important to note that the Bible does not explicitly state that Mary
                        Magdalene was a repentant sinner or a prostitute, as some later traditions have suggested. These
                        interpretations have been influenced by various cultural and artistic representations over time.

                    <p> <mark style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Connection with game lore</mark>: In
                        a cutscene we see Isaac with a wig, with kids laughing at him. From that, Maggy can be
                        interpreted as Isaac's humilation from nonconforming. <mark>As for the Bible</mark>, the theme
                        of repentance
                        is one found in a few of the game's endings. But considering her early addition, she's likely a
                        reflection of Isaac's desire to be healed of the demons the indoctination makes him think he's
                        full of.
