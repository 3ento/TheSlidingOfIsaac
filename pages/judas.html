                    <p>A damage multiplier is a hidden stat that calculates how much damage Isaac starts with. Given the

                        multiplier of 1.35 gives him around 75% more
                        damage from dmg ups <span style="font-size: 12px;">(ex. Pentagram- Isaac would get +1.69, while

                        high DPS, Judas' only concern is the low HP. So you'll generally want to play safer until you
                        amass some health. Blood of the Martyr<img src="../resources/images/items/Collectible_Blood_of_the_Martyr_icon_webp.png" alt=""> synergizes with his Book of Belial, so be on the lookout
                        for it. Any items that activate on low health, such as Whore of Babylon<img src="../resources/images/items/Collectible_Whore_of_Babylon_icon_webp.png" alt="">, Glyph of Balance <img src="../resources/images/items/Collectible_Glyph_of_Balance_icon_webp.png" alt=""> and Dark

                    <h1>Lore</h1>
                    <p>In the Bible, Judas refers to Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. Judas
                        is <mark>most famously known for betraying Jesus</mark>, leading to his arrest and crucifixion. The betrayal took place in the
                        Garden of Gethsemane, where Judas identified Jesus to the authorities by giving him a kiss.</p>

                    <p>According to the New Testament accounts in the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), Judas
                        agreed to betray Jesus
                        for thirty pieces of silver. The exact motivations behind Judas' actions are not explicitly
                        stated in the Bible, and
                        various interpretations exist. Some suggest that he was motivated by greed, while others propose
                        that he may have
                        been disappointed with Jesus' teachings or had other personal reasons.</p>

                    <p>Judas' betrayal is a significant event in Christian theology and has been the subject of artistic
                        and literary works
                        throughout history. The term "Judas" is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to someone who
                        betrays another
                        person, particularly a trusted friend or ally.</p>

                    <p> <mark style="font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Connection with game lore</mark>:
                        Isaac finds himself
                        sinful, so he imagines himself as famous sinners. The theme of betryal could be linked to Isaac
                        feeling guilty over
                        his parent's divorce, blaming himself, as if he "betrayed" them and the family as a whole.
